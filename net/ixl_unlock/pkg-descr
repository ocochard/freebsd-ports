This utility is inteded to be used on FreeBSD with if_ixl(4) driver.
It disables Module Qualification check to be able use any SFPs.

NOTE: since the datacheet is not clear about the location of PHY capability
data structure, I made some assumptions when did the search. If my assumptions
are wrong, this can damage your card. If you are not sure, do not use this
utility. Also, it looks like the location highly depends from the firmware
version.
